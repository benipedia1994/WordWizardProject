The game ends under the following scenarios

1. A Player runs out of turns

2. The Player uses all the available tiles

This is the game screen.  
![Game Screen](images/manual/game.png)

In the top row you have: 
- The total number of turns that have been played
- The total points you have accumulated this game so far
- The number of tiles remaining to be played

The next row represents the rack of letters you have to play with.  The point value of each letter is under each letter.

The next row represents the board.  This is similar to the rack of letters, but when forming a word, you must only use one of these letters.

The next row is a text input.  This is where you type in the letters you would like to use.  Under this input you have two buttons:
1. Make word will play the letters you have typed as a word
2. Swap will return your typed letters back to the pool in exchange for new onew.

At the bottom of the screen, you can choose to exit out of the game.

## Settings Screen
